# üöÄ [1079] [Letter Tile Possibilities](../medium/1079.py)

## Problem Statement

You have `n` tiles, where each tile has one letter `tiles[i]` printed on it.

Return the number of possible **non-empty** sequences of letters you can make using the letters printed on those tiles.

### üîπ Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: tiles = "AAB"
Output: 8
Explanation:
The possible sequences are: "A", "B", "AA", "AB", "BA", "AAB", "ABA", "BAA".
```

### üîπ Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: tiles = "AAABBC"
Output: 188
```

### üîπ Example 3:

```plaintext
Input: tiles = "V"
Output: 1
```

## üîé Solution Explanation

### üîπ Approach

1. **Backtracking with frequency counting**:
    - Use a counter to track the frequency of each character.
    - Explore all possible sequences recursively.
2. **Recursive DFS**:
    - For each character, reduce its count and recurse.
    - Restore the count after backtracking to explore all possibilities.
3. **Avoid duplicate sequences**:
    - The counter ensures each character is used only when available, preventing duplicate sequences.

### üîπ Python Code

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def numTilePossibilities(self, tiles: str) -> int:
        cnt = Counter(tiles)

        def dfs() -> int:
            ans = 0
            for c in cnt:
                if cnt[c]:
                    cnt[c] -= 1
                    ans += 1 + dfs()
                    cnt[c] += 1

            return ans

        return dfs()
```

## ‚è≥ Time Complexity Analysis

-   **Each tile can be used in different permutations**.
-   The worst case (all unique characters) leads to **O(n!)** complexity.
-   The backtracking approach **prunes** redundant paths efficiently.

## ‚úÖ Summary

-   **Recursive backtracking** effectively generates all unique sequences.
-   **Counter-based approach** prevents duplicate calculations.
-   **Time Complexity**: Worst case **O(n!)**, feasible for `n ‚â§ 7`.
