# 🚀 [38] [Count and Say](../medium/38.py)

## 📘 Problem Overview

The **Count and Say** sequence is a classic recursive pattern problem that evolves as follows:

1. `countAndSay(1) = "1"` (Base case)
2. `countAndSay(n)` = the run-length encoding (RLE) of `countAndSay(n - 1)`

> 🧠 **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)** is a method of compressing strings by counting repeating characters.  
> Example: `"3322251"` → `"23321511"`

---

## 🧠 Intuition

The magic is in **describing** the previous string:

-   If the previous string is `"21"`, we say:  
    “one 2” → `"12"`  
    “one 1” → `"11"`  
    Final result: `"1211"`

So, each step builds on the description of the previous result.

## 🛠️ Approach

We use a **dynamic programming array** `dp` to memoize each step of the sequence up to `n`.

### Steps:

1. Initialize `dp[1] = "1"`
2. For each `i` from 2 to `n`:
    - Take `dp[i-1]` (previous string)
    - Read it character by character
    - Group identical digits, and convert them into the format: `count + digit`
    - Append the result to `dp[i]`

## 👨‍💻 Code

```python
class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n: int) -> str:
        dp = [""] * (n + 1)
        dp[1] = "1"
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            prev = dp[i - 1]
            prev_len = len(prev)

            cnt = 1
            for j in range(prev_len):
                if j < prev_len - 1 and prev[j] == prev[j + 1]:
                    cnt += 1
                else:
                    dp[i] += f"{cnt}{prev[j]}"
                    cnt = 1

        return dp[n]
```

## 🔍 Example Walkthrough

### Input:

```txt
n = 4
```

### Step-by-step:

-   `dp[1] = "1"`
-   `dp[2] = "11"` → one 1
-   `dp[3] = "21"` → two 1s
-   `dp[4] = "1211"` → one 2, one 1

🔢 Output: `"1211"`

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

| Type  | Complexity                                          |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Time  | `O(n * m)` where `m` is the length of each sequence |
| Space | `O(n * m)` due to storing strings in `dp`           |
