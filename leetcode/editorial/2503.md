# 🚀 [2503] [Maximum Number of Points From Grid Queries](../hard/2503.py)

## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given:

-   An **`m x n` integer matrix `grid`**.
-   An **array `queries`** of size `k`.

For each **queries[i]**, start from the **top-left cell** `(0,0)` and follow these rules:

1. If `queries[i]` is **strictly greater** than the value of the current cell:
    - You earn **1 point** **if** this is the first time visiting that cell.
    - You can **move in all 4 directions** (up, down, left, right).
2. Otherwise, **you stop immediately** without earning points.

**Goal:**  
Return an array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the **maximum points** you can collect for `queries[i]`.

## 🔹 Example Walkthrough

### **Example 1**

```python
Input: grid = [[1,2,3],
               [2,5,7],
               [3,5,1]],
       queries = [5,6,2]

Output: [5,8,1]
```

✅ **Explanation:**

-   **Query `5`** → Start at `(0,0)`, collect `5` points.
-   **Query `6`** → Start at `(0,0)`, collect `8` points.
-   **Query `2`** → Start at `(0,0)`, collect `1` point.

### **Example 2**

```python
Input: grid = [[5,2,1],
               [1,1,2]],
       queries = [3]

Output: [0]
```

❌ **Explanation:**

-   **Query `3`** → The top-left cell `grid[0][0] = 5` is already **greater** than `3`.
    -   **No valid moves**, so **0 points**.

## 💡 Efficient Approach

### **Key Observations**

-   **Sort queries in ascending order** to process **smaller queries first**.
-   **Use a Min-Heap (Priority Queue)**:
    -   Always expand from the **smallest** cell value available.
    -   Push **adjacent cells** into the heap **only when visited for the first time**.
-   **Use a `seen` matrix** to **avoid revisiting cells** unnecessarily.

## 🔥 Optimized Implementation

```python
from heapq import heappop, heappush
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxPoints(self, grid: List[List[int]], queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        ROWS, COLS = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        DIRECTIONS = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # Up, Down, Left, Right

        # Step 1: Sort queries while keeping original index
        sorted_queries = sorted((q, i) for i, q in enumerate(queries))

        # Step 2: Min-Heap to explore the lowest-value cell first
        heap = [(grid[0][0], 0, 0)]  # (value, row, col)
        seen = [[False] * COLS for _ in range(ROWS)]
        seen[0][0] = True

        points = 0
        ans = [0] * len(queries)

        # Step 3: Process each query in sorted order
        for threshold, idx in sorted_queries:
            # Step 4: Expand heap while the top element is below the query threshold
            while heap and heap[0][0] < threshold:
                value, r, c = heappop(heap)
                points += 1  # Earn points for first-time visits

                # Step 5: Visit all valid neighbors
                for dr, dc in DIRECTIONS:
                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < ROWS and 0 <= nc < COLS and not seen[nr][nc]:
                        seen[nr][nc] = True
                        heappush(heap, (grid[nr][nc], nr, nc))

            ans[idx] = points  # Store the result for this query

        return ans
```

## 📈 Complexity Analysis

| Step                 | Complexity                        |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Sorting queries**  | \( O(k log k) \)                  |
| **Heap operations**  | \( O(mn log (mn)) \)              |
| **Total Complexity** | **\( O((mn + k) log (mn)) \)** ✅ |

✔ **Heap ensures we process the smallest values first**  
✔ **Efficiently handles up to `10^5` elements** 🚀
