# 🚀 [2140] [Solving Question With Brainpower](../medium/2140.py)

## 📝 Problem Breakdown

You are given a **2D array `questions`** where:

-   `questions[i] = [points_i, brainpower_i]`
-   **`points_i`** → Points earned if you solve question `i`
-   **`brainpower_i`** → Number of questions you must skip after solving `i`

💡 **Goal:** Maximize total points by either **solving or skipping** each question.

## 🔹 Example Walkthrough

### **Example 1**

```python
Input: questions = [[3,2],[4,3],[4,4],[2,5]]
Output: 5
```

**Steps:**

1. **Solve `question[0]`** → Earn **3 points**, skip `question[1]` & `question[2]`
2. **Solve `question[3]`** → Earn **2 points**
3. **Total = `3 + 2 = 5`**

✅ **Maximum points = `5`**

---

### **Example 2**

```python
Input: questions = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]]
Output: 7
```

**Steps:**

1. **Skip `question[0]`**
2. **Solve `question[1]`** → Earn **2 points**, skip `question[2]` & `question[3]`
3. **Solve `question[4]`** → Earn **5 points**
4. **Total = `2 + 5 = 7`**

✅ **Maximum points = `7`**

## 💡 Optimized Approach - Dynamic Programming

### **Key Observations**

-   We must decide at each step whether to **solve or skip** a question.
-   **Use `dp[i]` to store the max points achievable from index `i` onward.**

### **State Transition**

At **each index `i`**, we have **two choices**:

1. **Skip** → Use `dp[i+1]` (continue without solving)
2. **Solve** → Earn `points_i` + move to `i + brainpower_i + 1`

\[
dp[i] = max(dp[i+1], points[i] + dp[i + brainpower[i] + 1])
\]

### **Bottom-Up Approach**

1. **Iterate from the end (`N-1` to `0`)**.
2. **Compute max points at each index**.
3. **Return `dp[0]`** (max points starting from question `0`).

## 🔥 Optimized Python Code

```python
class Solution:
    def mostPoints(self, questions: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        N = len(questions)
        dp = [0] * (N + 1)  # DP array with extra space for boundary check

        for i in reversed(range(N)):
            points, brainpower = questions[i]
            next_q = i + brainpower + 1  # Next question that can be solved

            # Take max of skipping or solving the current question
            dp[i] = max(points + (dp[next_q] if next_q < N else 0), dp[i + 1])

        return dp[0]
```

## 📈 Complexity Analysis

| Step                          | Complexity     |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Iterate through questions** | \( O(N) \)     |
| **Update DP array**           | \( O(1) \)     |
| **Total Complexity**          | **\( O(N) \)** |

✔ **Efficient for `N ≤ 10^5`**  
✔ **Single pass, minimal extra space**
