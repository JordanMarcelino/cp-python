# 🚀 [3066] [Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value II](../medium/3066.py)

**Problem Statement**: Given an array of integers and a threshold `k`, determine the minimum number of operations required such that all elements are ≥ `k`. Each operation combines the two smallest elements into a new value.

**Examples**:

-   **Input**: `nums = [2,11,10,1,3], k = 10` → **Output**: `2`  
    (Operations combine `1&2` and `3&4` to achieve all elements ≥10)
-   **Input**: `nums = [1,1,2,4,9], k = 20` → **Output**: `4`  
    (Four operations needed to reach a single element of `33`)

## 🔍 **Key Insight: Prioritize the Smallest Elements**

Each operation must target the two smallest elements. Using a min-heap allows efficient access to these elements. The process continues until either:

1. All elements are ≥ `k` (checked via the two smallest), or
2. Only one element remains.

**Why This Works**: By always merging the smallest elements, we maximize the impact of each operation, reducing the number of elements below `k` as quickly as possible.

## 🛠 **Algorithm Breakdown**

1. **Heap Initialization**: Convert the array into a min-heap for O(1) access to the smallest elements.
2. **Iterative Merging**:
    - Extract the two smallest elements.
    - If both are ≥ `k`, stop (all elements meet the condition).
    - Otherwise, merge them and push the result back into the heap.
3. **Termination**: Stop when the heap has ≤1 element (all remaining elements are valid).

## 💻 **Code Implementation**

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        heapify(nums)

        ans = 0
        while True:
            if len(nums) <= 1:
                break

            x, y = heappop(nums), heappop(nums)
            if x >= k and y >= k:
                break

            heappush(nums, min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y))
            ans += 1

        return ans
```

**Explanation**:

-   **Heap Operations**: `heappop` and `heappush` maintain the heap structure efficiently.
-   **Early Termination**: Checks the two smallest elements directly from the heap to avoid unnecessary operations.

## 🧩 **Example Walkthrough**

For `nums = [1,1,2,4,9], k = 20`:

1. **Heap**: `[1,1,2,4,9]` → Merge `1&1` → `3` → Operations: 1
2. **Heap**: `[2,3,4,9]` → Merge `2&3` → `7` → Operations: 2
3. **Heap**: `[4,7,9]` → Merge `4&7` → `15` → Operations: 3
4. **Heap**: `[9,15]` → Merge `9&15` → `33` → Operations: 4  
   **Result**: All elements ≥20 → Return `4`.

## ⏱ **Complexity Analysis**

-   **Time Complexity**: **O(N log N)** → Each heap operation takes O(log N) time, and there are up to N operations.
-   **Space Complexity**: **O(N)** → Storing elements in the heap.

---

## 🎯 **Takeaways**

-   **Greedy Choice**: Merging the smallest elements first optimizes progress toward the threshold.
-   **Heap Efficiency**: Enables quick access to the smallest elements, crucial for minimizing operations.
-   **Edge Handling**: Directly checking the top two heap elements ensures early termination when possible.
