# 🚀 [2346] [Count Number of Bad Pairs](../medium/2364.py)

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. A pair of indices **(i, j)** is a **bad pair** if:

```
i < j  and  j - i != nums[j] - nums[i]
```

Return the **total number of bad pairs** in `nums`.

### 🔹 Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [4,1,3,3]
Output: 5
Explanation:
- (0, 1) is a bad pair since 1 - 0 != 1 - 4.
- (0, 2) is a bad pair since 2 - 0 != 3 - 4 (2 != -1).
- (0, 3) is a bad pair since 3 - 0 != 3 - 4 (3 != -1).
- (1, 2) is a bad pair since 2 - 1 != 3 - 1 (1 != 2).
- (2, 3) is a bad pair since 3 - 2 != 3 - 3 (1 != 0).
Total bad pairs: **5**.
```

### 🔹 Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 0
Explanation:
There are no bad pairs.
```

## 🔎 Solution Explanation

### 🔹 Observations

1. A pair `(i, j)` is **good** if:

    ```
    j - i = nums[j] - nums[i]
    ```

    Rearranging, we get:

    ```
    nums[j] - j = nums[i] - i
    ```

    This means that for each index `j`, we should check how many previous indices `i` have the same value of `nums[i] - i`.

2. Using a **hashmap (or Counter in Python)**, we can efficiently count occurrences of `nums[i] - i` seen so far.

### 🔹 Efficient Approach

1. Compute `nums[i] - i` for each index `i` and store the frequency in a **counter**.
2. The **total pairs** possible in an array of length N are `N * (N - 1) / 2`. This is a standard combination formula (N choose 2).
3. The **good pairs** can be calculated as follows: For each value `x` in the counter (representing a value of `nums[i] - i`), if it appears `count` times, then there are `count * (count - 1) / 2` good pairs associated with that value. Sum these up for all values in the counter.
4. Subtract the number of good pairs from the total number of pairs to get the number of **bad pairs**.

## 📝 Python Code

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countBadPairs(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        N = len(nums)
        counter = Counter([num - i for i, num in enumerate(nums)])

        total_pairs = N * (N - 1) // 2
        good_pairs = sum(cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 for cnt in counter.values())

        return total_pairs - good_pairs
```

## ⏳ Time Complexity Analysis

-   **Computing `nums[i] - i` and counting occurrences**: O(N)
-   **Computing total pairs**: O(1)
-   **Summing good pairs**: O(N) (in the worst case where all elements are distinct)
-   **Overall Complexity**: O(N)

## ✅ Summary

-   We use a **hashmap (Counter)** to track `nums[i] - i` values.
-   Compute **total pairs** using the combination formula.
-   Compute **good pairs** by summing up the combinations for each count in the counter.
-   **Subtract** good pairs from total pairs to get the **bad pairs count**.
-   The approach runs in **O(N) time complexity**.
