# 🚀 [873] [Length of Longest Fibonacci Subsequence](../medium/873.py)

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given a **strictly increasing** array of positive integers, find the length of the **longest Fibonacci-like subsequence**. If none exist, return `0`.

### 🔹 Example 1:

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest subsequence that is Fibonacci-like: [1,2,3,5,8].
```

### 🔹 Example 2:

```
Input: arr = [1,3,7,11,12,14,18]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest subsequence that is Fibonacci-like: [1,11,12], [3,11,14] or [7,11,18].
```

## 💡 Solution Approach

We can solve this problem using **Dynamic Programming (DP) with a two-pointer approach**.

### 🔍 Key Observations

1. The problem requires finding a **subsequence**, meaning elements can be skipped as long as order is maintained.
2. We need to check if two numbers **sum up** to the next number in the sequence.
3. Instead of checking all subsets, we use **a DP table** to store the length of Fibonacci-like subsequences ending at each pair of indices.

## 🔨 Implementation

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def lenLongestFibSubseq(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(arr)
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]  # DP table to store subsequence lengths

        ans = 0  # Stores max length found

        for i in range(2, n):
            prev = 0
            nxt = i - 1  # Two pointers

            while prev < nxt:
                target = arr[prev] + arr[nxt]

                if arr[i] > target:
                    prev += 1  # Need a larger sum, move left pointer forward
                elif arr[i] < target:
                    nxt -= 1  # Need a smaller sum, move right pointer backward
                else:
                    # Found a valid Fibonacci-like subsequence
                    dp[nxt][i] = dp[prev][nxt] + 1  # Extend the sequence
                    ans = max(ans, dp[nxt][i])  # Update max length found
                    prev += 1
                    nxt -= 1

        return ans + 2 if ans else 0  # +2 to account for the first two numbers
```

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

-   **Time Complexity:** \( O(n^2) \) — We iterate over pairs of indices and update the DP table.
-   **Space Complexity:** \( O(n^2) \) — We maintain a DP table of size \( n \times n \).

## 🏁 Walkthrough Example

Let's go through **arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]** step by step:

1. Start with `i = 2`, checking sums using two pointers.
2. If `arr[prev] + arr[nxt] == arr[i]`, update DP table and move pointers.
3. Continue scanning and updating the longest found subsequence.
4. Final answer: `5` (subsequence **[1,2,3,5,8]**).
