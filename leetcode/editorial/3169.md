# 🚀 [3169] [Count Days Without Meetings](../medium/3169.py)

## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given:

-   An integer `days` representing the **total number of available working days**.
-   A 2D array `meetings`, where each element `[start_i, end_i]` represents the **start and end days** of a scheduled meeting.

Your task is to **return the count of days** when the employee is **available for work but has no meetings**.

## 🔹 Example Walkthrough

### **Example 1**

```python
Input:
days = 10
meetings = [[5,7], [1,3], [9,10]]

Output: 2
```

✅ **Explanation:**

-   The **scheduled meeting days** are: **1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10**
-   The **available days** are: **4, 8**
-   ✅ **Answer: `2`**

---

### **Example 2**

```python
Input:
days = 5
meetings = [[2,4], [1,3]]

Output: 1
```

✅ **Explanation:**

-   The **scheduled meeting days** are: **1, 2, 3, 4**
-   The **available days** are: **5**
-   ✅ **Answer: `1`**

---

### **Example 3**

```python
Input:
days = 6
meetings = [[1,6]]

Output: 0
```

✅ **Explanation:**

-   The **scheduled meeting days** are: **1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6**
-   The **available days** are: **None**
-   ✅ **Answer: `0`**

## 💡 Efficient Approach

### **🔹 Key Observations**

1. **Merge Intervals Efficiently**:
    - Since meetings **may overlap**, we first **sort** the intervals by **start day**.
    - **Merge overlapping meetings** into a **single block**.
2. **Calculate Gaps Between Meetings**:
    - Iterate through the **merged** meeting intervals.
    - Count the **gaps (available days)** **between** these intervals.

## 🔨 Optimized Sorting + Interval Merging Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countDays(self, days: int, meetings: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        meetings.sort()  # Sort by start day

        prev_end = 0  # Track end of last merged meeting
        for start, end in meetings:
            start = max(start, prev_end + 1)  # Adjust start to avoid overlap
            interval = end - start + 1  # Meeting duration
            days -= max(interval, 0)  # Subtract meeting days from available days
            prev_end = max(prev_end, end)  # Update last merged meeting end

        return days
```

## 📈 Complexity Analysis

| Step                    | Complexity              |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Sorting Meetings**    | \( O(N log N) \)        |
| **Iterating & Merging** | \( O(N) \)              |
| **Total Complexity**    | **\( O(N log N) \)** ✅ |

-   **Efficient for large constraints** up to **\( 10^5 \) meetings**.
-   **Handles overlapping intervals** optimally.
