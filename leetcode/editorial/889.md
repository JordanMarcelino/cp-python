# 🚀 [889] [Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Postorder Traversal](../medium/889.py)

## 🧩 Problem Overview

**Objective**: Given `preorder` and `postorder` traversals of a binary tree, reconstruct the tree. The tree's nodes have distinct values.

**Key Observations**:

-   **Preorder**: Visits nodes in **Root → Left → Right** order.
-   **Postorder**: Visits nodes in **Left → Right → Root** order.
-   The root is the first element in `preorder` and the last in `postorder`.

## 🚀 Strategy: Stack-Powered Construction

**Core Idea**: Use a stack to track the current path of nodes. The stack helps determine the parent for each new node from `preorder`, while `postorder` signals when a node's children are fully processed.

### Steps:

1. **Initialize**: Start with the root (first element of `preorder`) and push it onto the stack.
2. **Process Nodes**: For each subsequent node in `preorder`:
    - Attach it as the left child (if available) or right child of the stack's top node.
    - Push the new node onto the stack.
3. **Check Completion**: If the stack's top node matches the next `postorder` value, pop it from the stack (all its children are processed).

## 🖥️ Code Walkthrough

```python
class Solution:
    def constructFromPrePost(self, preorder: List[int], postorder: List[int]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        root = TreeNode(preorder[0])
        stack = [root]
        i, j = 1, 0  # i: preorder index, j: postorder index

        while i < len(preorder):
            node = TreeNode(preorder[i])
            # Assign as left child if possible
            if not stack[-1].left:
                stack[-1].left = node
            else:
                stack[-1].right = node
            stack.append(node)

            # Pop nodes whose children are fully processed (postorder match)
            while stack and j < len(postorder) and stack[-1].val == postorder[j]:
                stack.pop()
                j += 1

            i += 1

        return root
```

### Key Components:

-   **Stack Initialization**: The root node is pushed first.
-   **Child Assignment**: Always prioritize left child first, then right.
-   **Postorder Check**: Nodes are popped from the stack once their children are fully processed (as per `postorder` sequence).

## 🌟 Example Walkthrough

**Input**: `preorder = [1,2,4,5,3,6,7]`, `postorder = [4,5,2,6,7,3,1]`

1. **Root (1)**: Push onto stack. `stack = [1]`.
2. **Node 2**: Attach as left of 1. `stack = [1, 2]`.
3. **Node 4**: Attach as left of 2. Check postorder (4 matches). Pop 4. `j=1`, `stack = [1, 2]`.
4. **Node 5**: Attach as right of 2. Check postorder (5 matches). Pop 5. `j=2`, `stack = [1, 2]`. Now, 2 matches postorder[2]. Pop 2. `j=3`, `stack = [1]`.
5. **Node 3**: Attach as right of 1. `stack = [1, 3]`.
6. **Node 6**: Attach as left of 3. Check postorder (6 matches). Pop 6. `j=4`, `stack = [1, 3]`.
7. **Node 7**: Attach as right of 3. Check postorder (7 matches). Pop 7. `j=5`, `stack = [1, 3]`. Now, 3 matches postorder[5]. Pop 3. `j=6`, `stack = [1]`. Finally, 1 matches postorder[6]. Pop 1. Tree complete!

**Result**: The reconstructed tree matches the example.

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

-   **Time**: **O(n)** — Each node is processed once. Each push/pop operation is O(1).
-   **Space**: **O(n)** — Stack size scales with tree height (worst case O(n) for skewed trees).
