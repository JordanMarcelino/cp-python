# 🚀 [2999] [Count the Number of Powerful Integers](../hard/2999.py)

# 🔍 Problem

You’re given `start`, `finish`, `limit`, and a string `s`. Your mission is to count how many numbers in the range `[start..finish]`:

-   End with the suffix `s` 📎
-   Every digit in the number is **less than or equal to** `limit` 🔒

We’ll call these **powerful integers** ⚡.

---

## 🧠 Intuition

A number is powerful if it **ends with `s`** and **every digit is ≤ limit**. So we’re looking for numbers that match this suffix pattern, but also stay within digit constraints.

Imagine `s = "124"` and `limit = 4`. Then:

-   `5124 ❌` → Starts with 5, which is above the limit.
-   `3124 ✅` → Every digit ≤ 4 and ends with "124".

We need to count all such numbers between `start` and `finish`.

## 🧩 Key Observations

1. Since `s` is a suffix, we can **build candidates** like: `s`, `1s`, `2s`, ..., as long as digits ≤ limit.
2. But doing this naively can be super slow when `finish` can go up to `10^15` 😨
3. So, we flip the problem: Instead of generating and checking each number, we’ll **count** how many valid numbers exist using **number manipulation** and a clever trick called **sanitization** 🔧

## 🛠️ Solution Breakdown

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfPowerfulInt(self, start: int, finish: int, limit: int, s: str) -> int:
        def sanitize(x: int) -> int:
            ans = 0
            less = False
            for c in map(int, str(x)):
                if less:
                    ans = ans * 10 + limit
                elif c > limit:
                    less = True
                    ans = ans * 10 + limit
                else:
                    ans = ans * 10 + c
            return ans

        def count(x: int) -> int:
            ans = 0
            base = limit + 1
            prefix = str(x)[:-len(s)]
            for c in map(int, prefix):
                ans = ans * base + c
            if int(prefix + s) <= x:
                ans += 1
            return ans

        return count(sanitize(finish)) - count(sanitize(start - 1))
```

## 🧮 Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 🔹 `sanitize(x)`

This function **rounds down** `x` to the largest number ≤ `x` where all digits are ≤ `limit`.

**Example:**  
`sanitize(5124)` with `limit = 4` → becomes `4444`  
Why? Because 5 > 4, so we replace it and all following digits with 4.

### 🔹 `count(x)`

Counts how many valid numbers ≤ `x` that end with `s`. It treats each prefix (the part before `s`) as a number in **base (limit + 1)** to avoid any digits > limit.

It then checks:  
🔍 _Is prefix + s ≤ x?_  
If yes → count it!

### ✨ Final Result

Just compute the difference between counts for `finish` and `start - 1` — and voilà, you have the total powerful integers in the range 🎯

## ⏱️ Time Complexity

-   `O(L)`, where `L` is the number of digits in `finish`
-   Efficient even for numbers up to `10^15` ✅

## ✅ Examples Recap

```txt
Input: start = 1, finish = 6000, limit = 4, s = "124"
Output: 5
Powerful integers: 124, 1124, 2124, 3124, 4124

Input: start = 15, finish = 215, limit = 6, s = "10"
Output: 2
Powerful integers: 110, 210

Input: start = 1000, finish = 2000, limit = 4, s = "3000"
Output: 0
```
