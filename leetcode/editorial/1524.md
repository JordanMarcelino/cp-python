# üöÄ [1524] [Number of Sub-arrays With Odd Sum](../medium/1524.py)

## **Problem Understanding:**

### Key Concepts:

-   A **subarray** is a contiguous portion of the array.
-   We need to determine how many of these subarrays have an **odd sum**.
-   If the sum of a subarray is **odd**, we count it.

### Example Walkthrough:

For the array `[1, 3, 5]`, the subarrays and their sums are:

-   Subarrays: `[[1], [1,3], [1,3,5], [3], [3,5], [5]]`
-   Their sums: `[1, 4, 9, 3, 8, 5]`
-   Odd sums: `[1, 9, 3, 5]`  
    Hence, the answer is `4` since there are four subarrays with odd sums.

---

## **Optimized Approach üí°**

### Observations:

-   The sum of an array or subarray can either be **odd** or **even**.
-   If we keep track of how many times we encounter an **odd** sum or **even** sum up to a certain point in the array, we can efficiently calculate how many subarrays ending at the current index have an **odd sum**.

### Key Insight:

-   If we know the sum of the elements up to a certain index (`total`), we can determine whether it is odd or even:
    -   If `total` is odd, it contributes to subarrays with odd sums.
    -   If `total` is even, it contributes to subarrays with even sums.

Thus, we maintain two variables:

-   `even`: Number of subarrays with an even sum up to the current point.
-   `odd`: Number of subarrays with an odd sum up to the current point.

### The Process:

1. For each number in the array:
    - Add it to the current total sum.
    - If the sum is odd, increment the count of odd subarrays.
    - If the sum is even, increment the count of even subarrays.
2. We track the count of both even and odd sums as we go through the array. Each time we encounter an odd sum, it means we‚Äôve found more subarrays with an odd sum.

## **Solution Code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def numOfSubarrays(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        MOD = 1e9 + 7  # The modulo value to prevent overflow

        ans = odd = total = 0  # Initialize the variables for the result, odd sums count, and current total sum
        even = 1  # We start with one even sum (considering the empty subarray with sum 0)

        for num in arr:
            total += num  # Add the current element to the total sum
            if total & 1:  # Check if the total sum is odd (using bitwise AND)
                ans = (ans + even) % MOD  # If odd, add the count of even subarrays to the result
                odd += 1  # Increment the count of odd subarrays
            else:
                ans = (ans + odd) % MOD  # If even, add the count of odd subarrays to the result
                even += 1  # Increment the count of even subarrays

        return int(ans)  # Return the result as an integer
```

---

## **Explanation of the Code:**

### 1. **Initialize Variables:**

-   `MOD`: Used to take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to avoid overflow.
-   `ans`: Stores the number of subarrays with an odd sum.
-   `odd`: Tracks the count of subarrays that have an odd sum.
-   `total`: Tracks the cumulative sum of the elements as we iterate through the array.
-   `even`: Initially set to 1 to account for the empty subarray, which has a sum of 0 (even).

### 2. **Iterate Over the Array:**

-   For each number in the array, we update the `total` sum.
-   We check if the current `total` sum is odd or even using the bitwise AND operation (`total & 1`):
    -   If the sum is odd, we add the number of even subarrays up to that point (`even`) to the result `ans`, since the odd sum can be formed by adding the current number to any even subarray sum.
    -   If the sum is even, we add the number of odd subarrays up to that point (`odd`) to the result `ans`.

### 3. **Update Counts:**

-   If the sum is odd, we increment the `odd` count.
-   If the sum is even, we increment the `even` count.

### 4. **Return the Result:**

-   Finally, the result is returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\) as required.

## **Time Complexity ‚è≥**

-   The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input array. This is because we are iterating through the array only once.

---

## **Space Complexity üíæ**

-   The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we are using only a few integer variables to store the counts and sums, regardless of the size of the input.

## **Example Walkthrough:**

### Input:

```python
arr = [1, 3, 5]
```

-   Subarrays and their sums:  
    `[[1], [1, 3], [1, 3, 5], [3], [3, 5], [5]]`  
    Sums: `[1, 4, 9, 3, 8, 5]`  
    Odd sums: `[1, 9, 3, 5]` ‚Üí **Answer = 4**

### Output:

```python
4
```

### Input:

```python
arr = [2, 4, 6]
```

-   All subarrays have even sums ‚Üí **Answer = 0**

### Output:

```python
0
```
