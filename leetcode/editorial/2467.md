# 🚀 [2467] [Most Profitable Path in a Tree](../medium/2467.py)

## **Problem Breakdown:**

We have an **undirected tree** with `n` nodes (labeled from 0 to n-1) rooted at node 0. Each node has a **gate** with a price (or reward), represented by the array `amount[]`.

-   If the value at `amount[i]` is negative, Alice needs to **pay** to open the gate.
-   If the value is positive, she **earns** a cash reward for opening it.
-   Both Alice and Bob can interact with gates along their paths.
-   If they reach a gate at the same time, they share the price/reward equally.

Alice's goal is to maximize her **net income** by moving towards the best leaf node, while Bob tries to get back to the root (node 0).

## **Step-by-Step Solution 🚶‍♀️💸**

### 1️⃣ **Graph Representation:**

We start by building the graph from the given edges, using an adjacency list. Each node has a list of its neighbors.

```python
graph = defaultdict(list)
for u, v in edges:
    graph[u].append(v)
    graph[v].append(u)
```

### 2️⃣ **Track Bob’s Path 🛤️:**

We need to calculate how far Bob is from each node. This helps us determine when Alice and Bob reach a node at the same time. To do this, we use **Depth First Search (DFS)** to track the number of steps Bob takes to reach node 0 from his starting point (`bob`).

```python
bob_step = [-1] * len(amount)

def dfs_bob(node: int, prnt: int, step: int) -> bool:
    if node == 0:
        return True
    for adj in graph[node]:
        if adj == prnt:
            continue
        if dfs_bob(adj, node, step + 1):
            bob_step[node] = step
            return True
    return False
```

### 3️⃣ **Alice’s Path and Profit Calculation 💸:**

Now we need to calculate Alice’s profit at each node. As Alice moves through the tree, she either earns or spends money depending on the gate’s value.

If Alice and Bob reach the node simultaneously, they **share** the reward or cost. If Alice reaches the node before Bob, she takes the full amount. If Alice reaches a leaf node, she stops.

```python
def dfs_alice(node: int, prnt: int, step: int) -> int:
    ans = 0
    if bob_step[node] == -1 or step < bob_step[node]:
        ans += amount[node]  # Alice takes the full amount if Bob hasn't reached yet
    elif step == bob_step[node]:
        ans += amount[node] // 2  # If they reach simultaneously, they split the reward/cost

    max_child_ans = float("-inf")
    for adj in graph[node]:
        if adj == prnt:
            continue
        child_ans = dfs_alice(adj, node, step + 1)
        max_child_ans = max(max_child_ans, child_ans)

    return ans if max_child_ans == float("-inf") else ans + max_child_ans
```

### 4️⃣ **Final Answer:**

We first calculate the steps Bob needs to reach node 0, and then we calculate the maximum profit Alice can get by following the optimal path towards a leaf node.

```python
dfs_bob(bob, -1, 0)
return dfs_alice(0, -1, 0)
```

### 🔹 Python Code

```python
class Solution:
    def mostProfitablePath(
        self, edges: List[List[int]], bob: int, amount: List[int]
    ) -> int:
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)

        bob_step = [-1] * len(amount)

        def dfs_bob(node: int, prnt: int, step: int) -> bool:
            if node == 0:
                return True

            for adj in graph[node]:
                if adj == prnt:
                    continue

                if dfs_bob(adj, node, step + 1):
                    bob_step[node] = step
                    return True

            return False

        def dfs_alice(node: int, prnt: int, step: int) -> int:
            ans = 0
            if bob_step[node] == -1 or step < bob_step[node]:
                ans += amount[node]
            elif step == bob_step[node]:
                ans += amount[node] // 2

            max_child_ans = float("-inf")
            for adj in graph[node]:
                if adj == prnt:
                    continue
                child_ans = dfs_alice(adj, node, step + 1)
                max_child_ans = max(max_child_ans, child_ans)

            return ans if max_child_ans == float("-inf") else ans + max_child_ans

        dfs_bob(bob, -1, 0)
        return dfs_alice(0, -1, 0)

```

## **Time Complexity ⏳**

-   Building the graph takes O(n) time, as we loop through all the edges.
-   DFS for calculating Bob’s path also takes O(n).
-   Finally, DFS for Alice’s path also takes O(n).

So, the total time complexity is **O(n)**.
