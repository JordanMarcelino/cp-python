# 🚀 [3105] [Longest Strictly Increasing or Strictly Decreasing Subarray](../easy/3105.py)

**Problem Statement**: You're given an array of integers. Your mission? Find the length of the longest **contiguous subarray** that's either **strictly increasing** or **strictly decreasing**. Think of it as hunting for the longest uphill climb or downhill slide in a numerical landscape!

**Examples**:

-   `nums = [1,4,3,3,2]` → Output: `2`  
    (Longest subarrays: `[1,4]` ↗️ or `[4,3]` ↘️)
-   `nums = [3,3,3,3]` → Output: `1`  
    (All elements are flat; no uphill/downhill possible)
-   `nums = [3,2,1]` → Output: `3`  
    (The entire array is a perfect downhill slide! 🎢)

## 🔍 **Intuition: The "Chain" Analogy**

Imagine building a chain where each link represents a number. The chain breaks if:

-   The next number isn't strictly larger (uphill) or smaller (downhill) than the previous.  
    We track **two chains** simultaneously: one for uphill, one for downhill. The moment a link breaks, we start a new chain!

**Key Insight**: For each number, check if it continues the uphill/downhill trend. Update chain lengths dynamically!

---

## 🛠 **Algorithm Breakdown**

Let's break down the solution step by step:

1. **Initialize Trackers**:

    - `n_inc`: Tracks the current uphill chain length (starts at `1`).
    - `n_dec`: Tracks the current downhill chain length (starts at `1`).
    - `ans`: Stores the maximum length found so far.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**:

    - Compare each number with its predecessor.
    - **If uphill** (`nums[i] > nums[i-1]`):
        - Extend the uphill chain → `n_inc += 1`.
        - Reset downhill chain → `n_dec = 1` (chain broke!).
    - **If downhill** (`nums[i] < nums[i-1]`):
        - Extend the downhill chain → `n_dec += 1`.
        - Reset uphill chain → `n_inc = 1`.
    - **If equal** → Both chains reset to `1` (flat terrain breaks both trends).

3. **Update the Maximum**:
    - After each step, update `ans` to be the max of itself and the current chain lengths.

## 🧩 **Example Walkthrough**

Let's visualize with `nums = [3,2,1]` (Output: `3`):

| Index | Num | Action           | `n_inc` | `n_dec` | `ans` |
| ----- | --- | ---------------- | ------- | ------- | ----- |
| 0     | 3   | Initialize       | 1       | 1       | 1     |
| 1     | 2   | 2 < 3 → Downhill | 1       | 2       | 2     |
| 2     | 1   | 1 < 2 → Downhill | 1       | 3       | 3     |

**Result**: The downhill chain grows to `3`, which becomes the answer.

## 💻 **Code Deep Dive**

Here's the Python solution dissected:

```python
class Solution:
    def longestMonotonicSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        N = len(nums)
        if N == 1:
            return 1  # Edge case: single element

        ans = 1  # Minimum possible length is 1
        n_inc, n_dec = 1, 1  # Trackers for uphill/downhill chains

        for i in range(1, N):
            if nums[i] > nums[i-1]:
                n_inc += 1  # Extend uphill
                n_dec = 1   # Reset downhill
            elif nums[i] < nums[i-1]:
                n_dec += 1  # Extend downhill
                n_inc = 1   # Reset uphill
            else:
                # Flat terrain: reset both chains
                n_inc = 1
                n_dec = 1

            # Update the maximum chain length found
            ans = max(ans, n_inc, n_dec)

        return ans
```

## ⏱ **Complexity Analysis**

-   **Time Complexity**: **O(N)** → We traverse the array once.
-   **Space Complexity**: **O(1)** → Constant extra space used.

---

## 🎯 **Takeaways**

-   **Track Trends Dynamically**: By updating chain lengths on-the-fly, we efficiently find the solution in one pass.
-   **Reset Chains Smartly**: Equality breaks both trends, so reset both trackers.
-   **Edge Cases Matter**: Handle single-element arrays gracefully!
