# 🚀 [1980] [Find Unique Binary String](../medium/1980.py)

## 🧩 Problem Breakdown

**Task**: Given an array `nums` containing `n` **unique** binary strings (each of length `n`), find **any** binary string of length `n` that **doesn't** appear in `nums`.

**Key Insight**:  
There are `2^n` possible binary strings of length `n`. However, the problem guarantees `nums` has exactly `n` strings. By focusing on a subset of `n+1` candidates (numbers `0` to `n`), we guarantee at least one is missing (thanks to the **pigeonhole principle**).

## 🚀 Approach: Pigeonhole Power

1. **Convert to Integers**: Treat each binary string in `nums` as an integer (e.g., "101" → 5).
2. **Track Seen Numbers**: Use a set to store these integers.
3. **Find the Missing Number**: Check numbers from `0` to `n` (inclusive). One **must** be missing!
4. **Convert Back**: Turn the missing number into a binary string, padding with leading zeros to ensure length `n`.

## 🖥️ Code Walkthrough

```python
class Solution:
    def findDifferentBinaryString(self, nums: List[str]) -> str:
        seen = set()
        for num in nums:
            seen.add(int(num, 2))  # Convert binary string to integer

        n = len(nums)
        for candidate in range(n + 1):  # Check 0 to n (n+1 candidates)
            if candidate not in seen:
                # Convert to binary and pad with leading zeros
                binary = bin(candidate)[2:]  # Remove '0b' prefix
                return f"{(n - len(binary)) * '0'}{binary}"

        return ""  # Unreachable due to pigeonhole principle
```

### Key Steps Explained:

1. **Convert Input**: Each binary string in `nums` is parsed into its integer equivalent and stored in `seen`.
2. **Check Candidates**: Loop through `0` to `n` (inclusive). Since there are `n+1` numbers and only `n` entries in `nums`, one number is guaranteed to be missing.
3. **Build Result**: Convert the missing number back to binary, ensuring it has exactly `n` digits by adding leading zeros.

## 🌟 Example: Solving "111", "011", "001"

-   **Input**: `nums = ["111","011","001"]` (integers `7`, `3`, `1`).
-   **Check Candidates**: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3` (since `n=3`).
-   **Missing Number**: `0` and `2` are missing. The code picks `0` first.
-   **Result**: `0` → binary `0` → pad to 3 digits → `"000"` (valid answer!).

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

-   **Time**: `O(n^2)`
    -   Converting `n` strings to integers: `O(n * n)` (each string has length `n`).
    -   Checking `n+1` candidates: `O(n)`.
-   **Space**: `O(n)` for storing seen integers.
