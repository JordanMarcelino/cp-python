# 🚀 [1415] [The k-th Lexicographical String of All Happy Strings of Length n](../medium/1415.py)

## 🧩 Understanding the Problem

**Happy String Rules**:

-   Made exclusively of 'a', 'b', 'c'.
-   No two **consecutive** characters can be the same.  
    Example: "aba" 😃 vs. "aab" 😞

**Goal**: Generate all valid happy strings of length `n`, sort them lexicographically (dictionary order), and return the **k-th** string. If there aren't `k` strings, return an empty string.

## 🌟 Intuition: Why DFS?

Imagine building a happy string one character at a time. At each step, you choose a character different from the previous one. This resembles exploring paths in a tree, where each branch represents a valid character choice. **DFS** naturally fits here—it systematically explores all paths, ensuring we generate strings in lexicographical order by prioritizing 'a' → 'b' → 'c' at each step.

## 🛠️ Approach: Crafting Happy Strings with DFS

1. **Start Small**: Begin with an empty string.
2. **Grow Smart**: At each step, append a character different from the last.
3. **Harvest at Full Length**: When the string reaches length `n`, add it to our collection.
4. **Sorting? Not Needed!**: By always choosing 'a' before 'b' before 'c', we generate strings in lex order automatically.

## 🖥️ Code Walkthrough: The DFS Engine

Let's dissect the Python solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def getHappyString(self, n: int, k: int) -> str:
        ans = []  # Stores all valid happy strings

        def dfs(i: int, txt: str) -> bool:
            # Base Case: String of length n is complete
            if i == n:
                ans.append(txt)
                return True

            # Try appending 'a', 'b', 'c' in order
            for c in "abc":
                # Skip if same as previous character
                if i > 0 and txt[-1] == c:
                    continue

                # Build the new string and recurse
                new_txt = txt + c
                dfs(i + 1, new_txt)

            return False  # Not used, but required for recursion

        dfs(0, "")  # Kickstart the DFS with empty string
        return ans[k-1] if k <= len(ans) else ""
```

### Key Code Insights:

-   **Base Case (`i == n`)**: When our string `txt` reaches length `n`, add it to `ans`.
-   **Character Selection**: Loop through 'a', 'b', 'c'. Skip `c` if it matches the last character in `txt`.
-   **DFS Invocation**: Start with `i=0` and an empty string. Each recursive call builds longer valid strings.

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

-   **Time**: Each level of recursion has up to 2 choices (can't pick previous char). Total nodes ≈ 3 * 2^(n-1) → **O(2^n)**.  
    *Feasible since n ≤ 10\*.
-   **Space**: Stores all valid strings, each of length n → **O(n \* 2^n)**.

## 🚀 Example Walkthrough: n=3, k=9

1. **DFS Exploration**:

    - Start with 'a', then 'b', 'c' (since no previous character).
    - For each first character, explore valid next steps, e.g., 'a' → 'b' or 'c'.

2. **Valid Strings**:

    - First few: "aba", "abc", "aca", "acb", ..., "cab" (the 9th).

3. **Result**: `ans[8]` (0-indexed) is "cab".
