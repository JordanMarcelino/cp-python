# üöÄ [1910] [Remove All Occurrences of a Substring](../medium/1910.py)

## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `part`, perform the following operation on `s` until all occurrences of the substring `part` are removed:

1. Find the leftmost occurrence of the substring `part` and remove it from `s`.
2. Return `s` after removing all occurrences of `part`.

### üîπ Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: s = "daabcbaabcbc", part = "abc"
Output: "dab"
Explanation:
- s = "daabcbaabcbc", remove "abc" starting at index 2, so s = "dabaabcbc".
- s = "dabaabcbc", remove "abc" starting at index 4, so s = "dababc".
- s = "dababc", remove "abc" starting at index 3, so s = "dab".
Now s has no occurrences of "abc".
```

### üîπ Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: s = "axxxxyyyyb", part = "xy"
Output: "ab"
Explanation:
- s = "axxxxyyyyb", remove "xy" starting at index 4 so s = "axxxyyyb".
- s = "axxxyyyb", remove "xy" starting at index 3 so s = "axxyyb".
- s = "axxyyb", remove "xy" starting at index 2 so s = "axyb".
- s = "axyb", remove "xy" starting at index 1 so s = "ab".
Now s has no occurrences of "xy".
```

## üîé Solution Explanation

### üîπ Approach

1. We need to remove all occurrences of the substring `part` from string `s` until it's no longer present.
2. This can be efficiently achieved by using a loop that continues as long as `part` is found in `s`.
3. In each iteration of the loop, we find and remove the first occurrence of `part` from `s`.
4. The loop ends when there are no more occurrences of `part` left in `s`.

### üîπ Python Code

```python
class Solution:
    def removeOccurrences(self, s: str, part: str) -> str:
        while part in s:
            s = s.replace(part, "", 1)
        return s
```

## ‚è≥ Time Complexity Analysis

-   **Checking if `part` exists in `s`**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the length of `s`.
-   **Replacing the first occurrence of `part`**: \(O(N)\), in the worst case.
-   The loop will run for as long as `part` is found, and since `s` will shrink with each iteration, the total number of operations will be proportional to \(O(N^2)\) in the worst case.

## ‚úÖ Summary

-   We iterate through the string and remove the first occurrence of `part` until it's no longer present.
-   This method guarantees all occurrences of `part` are removed.
-   The time complexity in the worst case is \(O(N^2)\), where \(N\) is the length of `s`.
