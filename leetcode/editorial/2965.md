# 🚀 [2965] [Find Missing and Repeated Values](../easy/2965.py)

## 📝 Problem Statement

We are given an **n × n** matrix `grid` where:

-   **Each integer** from `1` to `n²` **appears exactly once**, except:
    -   One **number appears twice** (denoted as `a`).
    -   One **number is missing** (denoted as `b`).
-   We need to **find and return `[a, b]`** in a **0-indexed** list.

---

## 🔹 Example 1

```
Input: grid = [[1,3],[2,2]]
Output: [2,4]
```

### 🔎 Breakdown

The numbers **from `1` to `4`** should appear in the `2 × 2` grid.

-   `1, 2, 2, 3` are present.
-   `2` appears **twice**. ✅
-   `4` is **missing**. ✅  
    ✅ Final Output: `[2, 4]`

---

## 🔹 Example 2

```
Input: grid = [[9,1,7],[8,9,2],[3,4,6]]
Output: [9,5]
```

### 🔎 Breakdown

The numbers **from `1` to `9`** should appear in the `3 × 3` grid.

-   `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9` are present.
-   `9` appears **twice**. ✅
-   `5` is **missing**. ✅  
    ✅ Final Output: `[9, 5]`

---

## 💡 Solution Approach

We need to **identify the repeated and missing numbers** efficiently.

### **🔹 Steps to Solve**

1️⃣ **Count occurrences** of each number using a hashmap (`Counter`).  
2️⃣ **Loop from `1` to `n²`** and check:

-   If a number appears **twice** → it's the **repeated number** `a`.
-   If a number **doesn’t appear** → it's the **missing number** `b`.  
    3️⃣ **Return `[a, b]`** as the final output.

⏳ **Time Complexity:** \( O(n^2) \) — We iterate over all elements once.  
📦 **Space Complexity:** \( O(n^2) \) — We use a hashmap to store counts.

## 🔨 Implementation

```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def findMissingAndRepeatedValues(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        N = len(grid)
        counter = defaultdict(int)

        # Step 1: Count occurrences of each number
        for row in grid:
            for num in row:
                counter[num] += 1

        # Step 2: Identify repeated and missing numbers
        repeated = missing = 0
        for val in range(1, N * N + 1):
            if counter[val] > 1:
                repeated = val
            if counter[val] == 0:
                missing = val

        return [repeated, missing]
```

## 🏁 Walkthrough Example

### 📌 Input

```python
grid = [[1,3],[2,2]]
```

### 🔄 Step-by-Step Execution

| Number | Count           |
| ------ | --------------- |
| **1**  | ✅ 1            |
| **2**  | 🚨 2 (Repeated) |
| **3**  | ✅ 1            |
| **4**  | ❌ 0 (Missing)  |

✅ **Final Output:** `[2, 4]`

## 🎯 Summary

✅ **Step 1:** Count occurrences using a hashmap.  
✅ **Step 2:** Identify the repeated and missing numbers.  
✅ **Step 3:** Return `[repeated, missing]`.  
✅ **Time Complexity:** \( O(n^2) \) ✅ **Space Complexity:** \( O(n^2) \)
