# 🚀 [3108] [Minimum Cost Walk in Weighted Graph](../hard/3108.py)

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an **undirected weighted graph** with `n` vertices labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and a set of **queries**, return the **minimum cost of a walk** between two nodes.

-   The **cost of a walk** is calculated as the **bitwise AND** of all edge weights traversed.
-   If there is **no path** between the nodes, return `-1`.

## 🔹 Example Walkthrough

### **Example 1**

```python
Input:
n = 5
edges = [[0,1,7], [1,3,7], [1,2,1]]
query = [[0,3], [3,4]]

Output: [1, -1]
```

✅ **Explanation:**

1. **For `(0 → 3)`:**
    - Walk: `0 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 3`
    - **Bitwise AND** calculation:  
      `7 & 1 & 1 & 7 = 1`
    - ✅ **Answer: `1`**
2. **For `(3 → 4)`:**
    - **No valid path** exists.
    - ❌ **Answer: `-1`**

---

### **Example 2**

```python
Input:
n = 3
edges = [[0,2,7], [0,1,15], [1,2,6], [1,2,1]]
query = [[1,2]]

Output: [0]
```

✅ **Explanation:**

-   **For `(1 → 2)`:**
    -   Possible paths:
        -   `1 → 2` (Weight `1`)
        -   `2 → 1` (Weight `6`)
        -   `1 → 2` (Weight `1`)
    -   **Bitwise AND** calculation:  
        `1 & 6 & 1 = 0`
    -   ✅ **Answer: `0`**

## 💡 Efficient Graph Processing Approach

### **🔹 Key Observations**

1. **Connected Components**:
    - If two nodes **belong to different components**, there is **no valid path** (`-1`).
2. **Bitwise AND Property**:

    - For any connected component, the **minimum cost** is determined by the **AND operation** across all edges in that component.

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
    - Used to **assign components** and compute the **minimum AND value** for each component.

## 🔨 Optimized BFS + Union-Find Solution

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minimumCost(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], query: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        weight = [(1 << 30) - 1] * n  # Initialize with maximum possible AND value
        group = [-1] * n  # Track connected components

        # Build adjacency list and compute AND across edges
        for u, v, w in edges:
            graph[u].append((v, w))
            graph[v].append((u, w))
            weight[u] &= w
            weight[v] &= w

        # BFS to identify connected components and compute minimum AND value
        def bfs(src: int) -> None:
            q = deque([src])
            while q:
                u = q.pop()
                weight[src] &= weight[u]  # Update min AND value for component

                for v, w in graph[u]:
                    if group[v] == -1:  # If node v is not visited
                        group[v] = src
                        q.append(v)

        # Identify components
        for i in range(n):
            if group[i] == -1:  # If node is unvisited
                group[i] = i
                bfs(i)

        # Answer queries
        return [
            weight[group[src]] if group[src] == group[dst] else -1
            for src, dst in query
        ]
```
