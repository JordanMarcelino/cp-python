# üöÄ [1718] [Construct the Lexicographically Largest Valid Sequence](../medium/1718.py)

## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, find a sequence that satisfies all of the following conditions:

1. The integer `1` occurs **once** in the sequence.
2. Each integer between `2` and `n` occurs **twice** in the sequence.
3. For every integer `i` between `2` and `n`, the distance between the two occurrences of `i` is **exactly `i`**.
4. The sequence should be **lexicographically largest**.

The distance between two numbers in the sequence, `a[i]` and `a[j]`, is given by \(|j - i|\).

It is guaranteed that a solution always exists under the given constraints.

### üîπ Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: n = 3
Output: [3,1,2,3,2]
Explanation:
- [2,3,2,1,3] is also valid, but [3,1,2,3,2] is the lexicographically largest valid sequence.
```

### üîπ Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: n = 5
Output: [5,3,1,4,3,5,2,4,2]
```

## üîé Solution Explanation

### üîπ Approach

1. **Backtracking with a greedy strategy**:
    - The sequence has `2n - 1` positions.
    - We try placing numbers from `n` down to `1` to ensure lexicographical order.
2. **Tracking used numbers**:
    - A `set` keeps track of used numbers to avoid placing them more than twice.
3. **Placement Rules**:
    - Place `i` at index `j` and `j + i` if possible.
    - If the current index is occupied, move to the next empty index.
    - If all numbers are placed successfully, return the sequence.

### üîπ Python Code

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def constructDistancedSequence(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        ans = [0] * (2 * n - 1)
        seen = set()

        def dfs(i: int) -> bool:
            if i == len(ans):
                return True

            if ans[i]:
                return dfs(i + 1)

            for num in reversed(range(1, n + 1)):
                if num in seen:
                    continue
                if num > 1 and (i + num >= len(ans) or ans[i + num]):
                    continue

                seen.add(num)
                ans[i] = num
                if num > 1:
                    ans[i + num] = num

                if dfs(i + 1):
                    return True

                seen.remove(num)
                ans[i] = 0
                if num > 1:
                    ans[i + num] = 0

            return False

        dfs(0)
        return ans
```

## ‚è≥ Time Complexity Analysis

-   The algorithm explores all valid placements using **backtracking**, leading to a worst-case complexity of **O(n!)**.
-   However, pruning significantly reduces unnecessary computations.

## ‚úÖ Summary

-   **Backtracking approach**: We try placing numbers from `n` down to `1`.
-   **Greedy strategy**: We prioritize placing **larger numbers first**.
-   **Efficient pruning**: Ensures only valid placements are considered.
-   **Time Complexity**: \(O(n!)\) in the worst case, but optimizations make it feasible for `n ‚â§ 20`.
