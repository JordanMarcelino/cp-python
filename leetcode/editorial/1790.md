# üöÄ [1790] [Check If One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal](../easy/1790.py)

**Problem Statement**: You‚Äôre given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length. Can you make them identical by swapping **two characters** in **exactly one** of the strings? Let‚Äôs find out!

**Examples**:

-   `s1 = "bank", s2 = "kanb"` ‚Üí Output: `true`  
    (Swap indices `0` and `3` in `s2` to get `"bank"` üè¶)
-   `s1 = "attack", s2 = "defend"` ‚Üí Output: `false`  
    (Too many differences to fix with one swap! ‚öîÔ∏è)
-   `s1 = "kelb", s2 = "kelb"` ‚Üí Output: `true`  
    (Already identical‚Äîno swap needed! üéâ)

## üîç **Intuition: The "Difference Detective" Approach**

Imagine you‚Äôre a detective comparing two strings. Your clues are the positions where characters **differ**. To solve the case:

1. **No differences?** Case closed‚Äîstrings are already the same!
2. **Exactly two differences?** Check if swapping these positions in one string mirrors the other.
3. **More than two differences?** Impossible to fix with one swap!

**Key Insight**: A single swap can fix **at most two mismatches** if they‚Äôre mirror images of each other.

## üõ† **Algorithm Breakdown**

Let‚Äôs decode the strategy:

1. **Check Lengths**: If `s1` and `s2` have different lengths, return `false` (though constraints say they‚Äôre equal).
2. **Find Differences**: Identify all indices where `s1` and `s2` differ.
3. **Evaluate Cases**:
    - **Zero differences**: Return `true` (already identical).
    - **Two differences**: Check if `s1[i] == s2[j]` and `s1[j] == s2[i]` for the differing indices `i` and `j`.
    - **Any other count**: Return `false`.

## üß© **Example Walkthrough**

Let‚Äôs analyze `s1 = "bank"` and `s2 = "kanb"` (Output: `true`):

1. **Identify Differences**:
    - Index `0`: `s1[0] = 'b'` vs `s2[0] = 'k'`
    - Index `3`: `s1[3] = 'k'` vs `s2[3] = 'b'`
2. **Check Swap Compatibility**:
    - `s1[0] == s2[3]` ‚Üí `'b' == 'b'` ‚úÖ
    - `s1[3] == s2[0]` ‚Üí `'k' == 'k'` ‚úÖ
3. **Conclusion**: Swapping indices `0` and `3` in `s2` makes them match!

## üíª **Code Deep Dive**

Here‚Äôs the Python solution decoded:

```python
class Solution:
    def areAlmostEqual(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        if len(s1) != len(s2):
            return False

        # Find indices where characters differ
        diff = [i for i, (a, b) in enumerate(zip(s1, s2)) if a != b]

        # Case 1: No differences ‚Üí already equal
        # Case 2: Exactly two differences that are mirror-swappable
        return (
            not diff or
            (len(diff) == 2 and
             s1[diff[0]] == s2[diff[1]] and
             s1[diff[1]] == s2[diff[0]])
        )
```

**Why This Works**:

-   `zip(s1, s2)` pairs characters for easy comparison.
-   `diff` captures mismatched indices efficiently.
-   The final check ensures the two mismatches are swap-fixable.

## ‚è± **Complexity Analysis**

-   **Time Complexity**: **O(N)** ‚Üí Single pass to find differences.
-   **Space Complexity**: **O(1)** ‚Üí Storing at most two indices in `diff`.

---

## üéØ **Takeaways**

-   **Spot the Mismatches**: Track differing indices to narrow down possibilities.
-   **Mirror Check**: For two mismatches, ensure characters are cross-matching.
-   **Edge Cases**: Already equal strings and invalid mismatch counts are handled gracefully.
