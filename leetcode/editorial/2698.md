# üöÄ [2698] [Find the Punishment of an Integer](../medium/2698.py)

## Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `n`, return the **punishment number** of `n`.

The punishment number of `n` is defined as the sum of the squares of all integers `i` such that:

-   `1 <= i <= n`
-   The decimal representation of `i*i` can be partitioned into contiguous substrings such that the sum of the integer values of these substrings equals `i`.

### üîπ Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: n = 10
Output: 182
Explanation:
- 1 since \(1^2 = 1\).
- 9 since \(9^2 = 81\), and \(81\) can be partitioned into \(8 + 1 = 9\).
- 10 since \(10^2 = 100\), and \(100\) can be partitioned into \(10 + 0 = 10\).
- Sum: \(1 + 81 + 100 = 182\).
```

### üîπ Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: n = 37
Output: 1478
Explanation:
- 1 since (1^2 = 1).
- 9 since (9^2 = 81), and (81) can be partitioned into (8 + 1).
- 10 since (10^2 = 100), and (100) can be partitioned into (10 + 0).
- 36 since (36^2 = 1296), and (1296) can be partitioned into (1 + 29 + 6).
- Sum: (1 + 81 + 100 + 1296 = 1478).
```

## üîé Solution Explanation

### üîπ Approach

1. **Check partition validity**:
    - Given \( i^2 \), try partitioning it into contiguous substrings.
    - If their sum equals `i`, include \( i^2 \) in the sum.
2. **Recursive approach**:
    - Use recursion to explore all valid partitions.
    - Try splitting at different points (dividing by 10, 100, etc.).
3. **Summing valid squares**:
    - Iterate through `1` to `n`, checking which numbers satisfy the condition.
    - Sum the squares of valid numbers.

### üîπ Python Code

```python
class Solution:
    def punishmentNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        def is_partition_equal(num: int, target: int) -> bool:
            if num == target:
                return True
            if num == 0:
                return target == 0

            for div in [10, 100, 1000]:
                if is_partition_equal(num // div, target - num % div):
                    return True
            return False

        return sum([sqr for i in range(1, n + 1) if is_partition_equal(sqr := i * i, i)])
```

## ‚è≥ Time Complexity Analysis

-   **Checking partition validity**: Recursive approach may take \(O(log n)\) steps per number.
-   **Looping from `1` to `n`**: \(O(n)\)
-   **Overall Complexity**: Approx. \(O(n log n)\) in the worst case.

## ‚úÖ Summary

-   We **recursively** check whether `i^2` can be partitioned into valid substrings.
-   We **sum all valid squares** to obtain the punishment number.
-   The approach efficiently finds and verifies valid partitions.
