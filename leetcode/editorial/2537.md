# 🚀 [2537] [Count the Number of Good Subarrays](../medium/2537.py)

## 📘 Problem Overview

You're given:

-   An integer array `nums`
-   An integer `k`

🔍 **Goal:** Count the number of **good subarrays**, where a subarray is considered **good** if it contains at least `k` pairs of indices `(i, j)` such that:

-   `i < j`
-   `nums[i] == nums[j]`

A **subarray** must be **contiguous**.

---

## 🧠 Intuition

Think of it like this:

-   Every time you extend a subarray, you're potentially forming more equal pairs.
-   But counting all pairs in every subarray would be **too slow** (O(n²) 😰).

### 🔥 Optimization Idea:

Use a **sliding window** to dynamically keep track of:

-   How many equal pairs exist in the current window.
-   Expand the right end of the window, and **shrink the left** until you fall below `k` pairs.
-   Every time a window has **at least `k` pairs**, it contributes `l` good subarrays (where `l` is the leftmost index of the window).

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Strategy

1. Use a hashmap `counter` to track how many times each number appears in the current window.
2. Keep a variable `k` that counts **how many more equal pairs** we need to reach the threshold.
3. Slide the window from left (`l`) to right (`r`) and:
    - Decrease `k` based on how many duplicates of `nums[r]` we already have.
    - While we have at least `k` pairs, shrink the window from the left.
4. Each valid window contributes `l` good subarrays (because any subarray that ends at `r` and starts at index `< l` is also valid!).

## 👨‍💻 Code

```python
class Solution:
    def countGood(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        from collections import defaultdict

        counter = defaultdict(int)
        l = ans = 0

        for r in range(len(nums)):
            k -= counter[nums[r]]
            counter[nums[r]] += 1

            while k <= 0:
                counter[nums[l]] -= 1
                k += counter[nums[l]]
                l += 1

            ans += l

        return ans
```

## 🔍 Example Walkthrough

### Example 1:

```txt
nums = [1,1,1,1,1], k = 10
```

All pairs are `(i, j)` with `i < j`, all values are `1`.

-   Total pairs = C(5, 2) = 10 ✅
-   Only one subarray has 10 pairs: the whole array.

🔢 Output: `1`

---

### Example 2:

```txt
nums = [3,1,4,3,2,2,4], k = 2
```

We need subarrays with **at least 2 equal pairs**:

-   `[3,1,4,3,2,2]` → pairs: (3,3), (2,2)
-   `[3,1,4,3,2,2,4]` → add (4,4)
-   `[1,4,3,2,2,4]` → same as above
-   `[4,3,2,2,4]` → same

🔢 Output: `4`

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

| Type  | Complexity       |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| Time  | `O(n)`           |
| Space | `O(n)` (hashmap) |

No nested loops. Pure sliding window elegance ✨
