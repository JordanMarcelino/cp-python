# 🚀 [1092] [Shortest Common Supersequence](../hard/1092.py)

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given two strings **str1** and **str2**, find the **shortest string** that contains both **str1** and **str2** as **subsequences**.  
If multiple answers exist, return any.

### 🔹 Example 1:

```
Input: str1 = "abac", str2 = "cab"
Output: "cabac"
Explanation:
- "abac" is a subsequence of "cabac" (delete the first 'c').
- "cab" is a subsequence of "cabac" (delete "ac" from the end).
```

### 🔹 Example 2:

```
Input: str1 = "aaaaaaaa", str2 = "aaaaaaaa"
Output: "aaaaaaaa"
```

## 💡 Solution Approach

We can solve this problem using **Dynamic Programming (DP)** with the **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) approach**.

### 🔍 Key Observations

1. If we find the **LCS** of `str1` and `str2`, we can **merge the two strings** while minimizing extra characters.
2. The **Shortest Common Supersequence (SCS)** can be built by adding **non-LCS characters** from both strings while keeping the LCS in order.

## 🔨 Implementation

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def shortestCommonSupersequence(self, str1: str, str2: str) -> str:
        N, M = len(str1), len(str2)

        # Step 1: Compute LCS Length using DP
        dp = [[0] * (M + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)]
        for i in reversed(range(N)):
            for j in reversed(range(M)):
                if str1[i] == str2[j]:
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i + 1][j + 1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j + 1])

        # Step 2: Construct the SCS by merging str1 and str2 while keeping LCS order
        ans = []
        i = j = 0

        while i < N and j < M:
            if str1[i] == str2[j]:
                ans.append(str1[i])  # Add common character
                i += 1
                j += 1
            elif dp[i + 1][j] > dp[i][j + 1]:
                ans.append(str1[i])  # Add extra char from str1
                i += 1
            else:
                ans.append(str2[j])  # Add extra char from str2
                j += 1

        # Add remaining characters from str1 or str2
        while i < N:
            ans.append(str1[i])
            i += 1

        while j < M:
            ans.append(str2[j])
            j += 1

        return "".join(ans)
```

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

-   **Time Complexity:** \( O(N \* M) \) — Due to the DP table computation.
-   **Space Complexity:** \( O(N \* M) \) — DP table stores LCS results.

## 🏁 Walkthrough Example

Let's go through **str1 = "abac"** and **str2 = "cab"** step by step:

### 🔹 Step 1: Compute LCS

```
LCS of "abac" and "cab" = "ab"
```

### 🔹 Step 2: Merge into Shortest Common Supersequence

We insert **extra characters** while keeping "ab" in order:

```
Merge result: "cabac"
```

✅ "cabac" contains both "abac" and "cab" as subsequences.

## 🎯 Summary

✅ Used **Dynamic Programming** to find **LCS**  
✅ Constructed **Shortest Common Supersequence** efficiently  
✅ Achieved **O(N × M) complexity**, optimal for `N, M ≤ 1000`
